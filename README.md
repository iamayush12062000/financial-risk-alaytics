Financial Risk Analytics Platform
📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design and implement a containerized, production-style financial risk analytics platform using Kubernetes.

This platform simulates a real-world portfolio risk monitoring system similar to what investment banks and financial institutions use to track:

Portfolio performance
Daily returns
Rolling volatility
Sharpe Ratio
Value at Risk (VaR)
PnL trends

The system is fully deployed on a local Kubernetes cluster and designed using modern data engineering best practices.
